  * Stop relaxing build rules only required in DEB_MAINTAINER_MODE, and

    copyright-check rule for putting aside upstream autobuilt files
    during build, so always need a new CDBS.

  * Build-depend on devscripts and dh-buildinfo.
  * Set urgency=medium as above affects only packaging hints and the
    prior 0.4.0-2 release was kept from entering testing due to a too
    old version of cdbs on hppa buildd.

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * src/lrdf_md5.h: Fix symbol conflicts with other MD5 implementations.
    Exporting symbols like md5_init() is not a good idea. This fixes
    the crashes when initializing the GStreamer when the LADSPA plugin
    is installed (which should be the case in all installations).
    Essentially this made pidgin, empathy, totem and a lot of other
    applications unusable (Closes: #521898).
